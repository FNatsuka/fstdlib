# fstdlib
A C++ library designed for OI.

## Features

- Polynomial Class that supports most operations like convolution, square root, logarithm and exponential function.
- Arbitrary Module Polynomial Class that supports most operations as the Polynomial Class.

## Update Log

### Build v0.1.0
- poly.h is published.
- Many features are not well-developed yet.

### Build v0.1.1
- Arrays are replaced with `std::vector`.
- `mod` and `grt` are variable now. You can always modify them by accessing `fstdlib::mod` and `fstdlib::grt`.

## Schedule

- [x] Make constants like `mod` and `grt` variable.
- [ ] Overload more operators.
- [x] Replace arrays with `std::vector`.
- [ ] Network flow support.
